# grocery_price_aggregator
A grocery price aggregator for Singapore. For quick price comparisons across various supermarket chains in Singapore.

Original intent was to do it in Python, but I realised google sheets offered a quick alternative.
It aggregates prices from NTUC, Cold Storage, Sheng Siong, Giant and Redman. The input search term mobile sheet shows the top 7 results from each store for easier readability on mobile devices, while the input search term sheet is better suited for desktop viewing. The search results are very unpredictable as it uses the various sites' search, which are not very well implemented. Some searches for things you may think obvious end up returning nothing or totally unrelated items.

As it were, this is best suited for people who live close to several different supermarkets and wanted to do a quick price comparison to decide which one to head to to pick up something.
